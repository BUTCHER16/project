Basics of Operating System (Computer System Operation)

Some basic knowledge of the structure of Computer System is required to understand
how Operating Systems work.

-> A modern general-purpose computer system consists of one or more CPUs and
a number of device controllers connected through a common bus that provides access
to shared memory.

mkdir: This command is used to create a new directory in a file system. The syntax is mkdir directory_name. For example, mkdir my_folder will create a new folder called "my_folder" in the current directory.

dirname: This command returns the directory name of a given path. For example, dirname /home/user/documents/file.txt will return /home/user/documents.

symlink: This command creates a symbolic link from one file to another. The syntax is ln -s target_file link_file. For example, ln -s /home/user/documents/file.txt /home/user/link_file will create a symbolic link from "/home/user/link_file" to "/home/user/documents/file.txt".

readlink: This command prints the value of a symbolic link. The syntax is readlink link_file. For example, readlink /home/user/link_file will print "/home/user/documents/file.txt".

link: This command creates a hard link from one file to another. A hard link is a reference to the same file, so changes to either file will affect both. The syntax is ln target_file link_file. For example, ln /home/user/documents/file.txt /home/user/link_file will create a hard link from "/home/user/link_file" to "/home/user/documents/file.txt".

poll(): This is a system call used to monitor file descriptors for events. It allows a program to wait until one or more events occur on a set of file descriptors. For example, a program might use poll() to wait for data to become available on a network socket.

stat: This command retrieves information about a file or directory, such as its size, ownership, and permissions. The syntax is stat filename. For example, stat /home/user/documents/file.txt will display information about the file "file.txt".

sync: This command writes any pending changes to the file system to disk. It is typically used before shutting down a system to ensure that all changes have been saved.

nftw(): This is a function in the C programming language used to recursively walk a directory tree. It allows a program to perform an action on each file or directory in the tree. For example, a program might use nftw() to count the number of files in a directory tree.
